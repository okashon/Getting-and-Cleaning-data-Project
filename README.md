In this repository we will find the submission of Jorge Carri√≥n for the "Getting and cleanning data Course Project". It contains the script of the data analysis "run_analysis.R" where we can find all the steps to get through the project and complete the analysis on the "Human activity Recognition Using Smartphone" data set.

 Files:

1. Codebook.md: A code book with description of all the variables, the data, and any work on the data set to clean it up.

2. run_analysis.R: Contains all the proccess and preparation to get through the 5 steps required to complete the Course project. it works as follow: 
	-First it read the test and training sets and assign them to to a variable.
	-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	-From the data set in step created before, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

3. Tidy_data.txt: Is the result of the steps described above to get a tidy data.
